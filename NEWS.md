#### v.0.3.1.911 ####

changes
- new automated removal of leading and trailing NAs. Error abort if NA within series
- new search optimisation option
- added documentation for tsMetal.RData
- added internal sum squared error function for the optimiser
- added passing optim setting int trough Gompertz and GSGompertz initialisation
- added error handling for optimx function
- changed non-critical warnings to type message, to allow easy surpression
- bass() function implementing Bass Model, together with plot(), print(), nobs(), logLik() and actuals() methods.
- is.diffusion() and is.bass() functions
- Seasonality in the Bass model. Currently the fixed one is supported.
- renamed option variable l to loss (for l-norm selection)
- renamed option variable x to y (the response variable)
- introudced initpar argument to allow manual initalisation, preset and automatic
- introduced mscal argument to scale market potential for better optimisation results
- updated documentation for diffusion() - Thx Ivan!


bugfixes
